### Components

#### 1. Client-Side Encryption Module
- Encrypts motion data immediately on the wearable device or local app  
- Ensures raw patient information never leaves the user’s control  

#### 2. FHE Analysis Engine
- Performs computations on encrypted exercise data  
- Produces aggregated metrics like progress trends, completion rates, and exercise quality  

#### 3. Therapist Dashboard
- Displays encrypted, aggregated insights  
- Supports tailored guidance while maintaining patient privacy
